    <h1>WHAT IS UNEMPLOYMENT?</h1>
    <P>unemployment is when people who are actively seeking work cannot find jobs. It reflects an economy's health and is typically measured as the "unemployment rate", which represents the percentage of the labour force that is jobless but seeking employment.Unemployment is a very serious issue not only in India but in the whole world. There are hundreds and thousands of people out there who do not have employment. Besides, the problems of unemployment are very severe in India because of the growing population and demand for jobs. Moreover, if we neglect this problem then it will be going to become the reason for the doom of the nation.

    <p><b>1. Frictional Unemployment</b>: This occurs when people are between jobs or just entering the labor market. It's often temporary and reflects the normal time it takes to find a new position. Frictional unemployment is a type of short-term unemployment that occurs when workers look for new employment or transition out of old jobs and into new ones. This temporary period of unemployment is the result of voluntary transitions within an economy.

    <p><b>2. Structural Unemployment</b>: This happens when there's a mismatch between workers' skills and the jobs available, often due to technological changes or shifts in the economy, such as industries declining or evolving. Structural unemployment occurs because workers lack the requisite job skills or live too far from regions where jobs are available and cannot move closer. Jobs are available, but there is a serious mismatch between what companies need and what workers can offer.6 Jan 2023

    <p><b>3. Cyclical Unemployment</b>: This is linked to the economic cycle. In times of recession, businesses may cut jobs, leading to higher unemployment, whereas in growth periods, jobs tend to increase. Cyclical unemployment refers to the unemployment which is caused by the changes in business cycles, that is economic upturn or downturn. Cyclical unemployment is a component of overall unemployment and is affected by the economic recession or expansion.</p>

    <p><b>4. Seasonal Unemployment</b>: Certain industries, like agriculture or tourism, have seasonal patterns, leading to employment fluctuations throughout the year. Seasonal unemployment refers to the fluctuation of employment levels in certain industries or occupations that are affected by seasonal changes, such as farming, construction, and tourism. These industries tend to have a high demand for workers during certain times of the year and a low demand during other times.</p>

    <p><b>5. Long-term Unemployment</b>: This involves people who have been out of work for a prolonged period, often due to lack of skills, education, or training relavant to current job markets. Lack of employment opportunities results in loss of faith in the government and this often leads to political instability. The dissatisfaction level among unemployed people increases and it can gradually lead to anxiety, depression and other mental health problems. </p>
    <h1>Causes of Unemployment in India</h1>
    <p>This can be attributed to various factors, both structural and cyclical. Here are some of the major causes:</p>
    <p>1. Population Growth: The supply of labor surpasses the available job opportunities, leading to higher unemployment rates.</p>
    
    <p>2. Lack of Skill Development: There is often a mismatch between the skills possessed by the workforce and the skills demanded by the industries, resulting in high unemployment rates, particularly among the youth.
    <p>3. Slow Industrial Growth: Limited investment in industries can lead to fewer job opportunities, exacerbating the existing situation.
    </p>
    <p>4. Agricultural Dependence: Overdependence on agriculture, coupled with limited diversification into other sectors, contributes to high unemployment rates.</p>
    <p>5. Technological Advancements: As technology replaces manual labor, certain jobs become obsolete, leaving workers unemployed.</p>
    <p>6. Economic Disparities: Some areas lack adequate infrastructure, industries, and job opportunities, leading to higher unemployment rates in those regions. </p>
    <p>7. Inadequate Education System: The education system in India often struggles to provide practical skills and job-oriented training, leading to a gap between education and employment. </p>
    <p>8. Informal Sector Dominance: A significant portion of employment in India is in the informal sector, which lacks job security, social security benefits, and stable income. Informal sector workers face uncertain employment prospects, contributing to overall unemployment.</p>
    </p><h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>The unemployment rate in India inched higher to 7.45% in February 2023, taking the total number of unemployed in the country to 33 million. India needs to make dedicated efforts in order to decrease the number of unemployed people.
    </p>
    <p>By following a comprehensive approach including skilling of people, better education, increased focus on labor-intensive sectors, etc. India will be able to decrease the unemployment rate substantially. </p>
